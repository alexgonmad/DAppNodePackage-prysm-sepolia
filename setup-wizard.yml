    title: Add a backup web3 provider
    description: >-
      It's a good idea to add a backup web3 provider in case your main one goes down. For example, if your primary EL client is a local Geth, but you want to use Infura as a backup.
      Get your web3 backup from another machine here is where you have to write the IP address and port or url.
